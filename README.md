# Air Quality Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes air quality data over a one-year period to identify trends and patterns for environmental research purposes. The visualizations help communicate findings about air quality variations across different timeframes.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Simulated EPA-style air quality data
- **Period**: February 2023 - January 2024
- **Parameters**: AQI, PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, O₃ levels
- **Frequency**: Daily measurements

## Visualizations
1. **AQI Trends Over Time**: Line graph showing daily AQI with 7-day moving average
2. **Monthly Comparison**: Bar charts and box plots comparing air quality across months and seasons
3. **Pollutant Analysis**: Trends of different pollutants throughout the year
4. **Heatmap**: AQI distribution by month and day of week

## Key Findings
- Seasonal patterns show variations in air quality
- Identification of best/worst months for air quality
- Analysis of pollutant contributors
- Weekly patterns and their impact on air quality

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook `air_quality_analysis.ipynb` to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
